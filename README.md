# SocialNetworkAPI

## Description
This application centers on the use of mongoDB and mongoose. It has no front end, but can be accessed with insomnia. In the process of building it I learned how CRUD routes work with mongoose, and how a mongoDB backend differs from a regular node express backend.  

## Installation
Run npm install to install the necessary node packages, and mongoDB for the database.

## Usage
See video walkthrough below. Use node to activate the server from the command line, and then use insomnia to access the get, post, put, and delete routes for the user and thought models. You can also add users to another user's friend list, and add reactions to thoughts.

## Credits
I recieved some assistance and advice in building this application from my tutor, Vinnie Lopez.
